# As of June 8:
#
#  This file can serve two different (but related) roles:
#    1) Overriding a bunch of default settings in the docker-compose.yml
#    2) Overriding default settings in the API node.js app
#
#  In case #1 the .env file is read by docker-compose, setting any value in a ${var} block
#  (this includes a bunch of vars that are used in case #2)
#
#  In case #2 the .env file is read by the node.js app directly, so only values that are
#  defined in the app have any meaning (the docker vars (most likely) are ignored)


### Vars just used by docker-compose
#   --------------------------------
## MODEL_DIR - directory that the NLP projects model will be stored in
#MODEL_DIR=./nlu-model
## REDIS_DATA - directroy that the redis database will be store in
#REDIS_DATA=./redis-data

### Vars used by the node.js app (which are ALSO projected through the docker-compose)
#   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## RASA_URL - the url the app will try and reach RASA via
#RASA_URL=http://rasa:5000
## DUCKLING_URL - the url the app will try and rach Duckling via
#DUCKLING_URL=http://haskduck:8000
## REDIS_URL - the url the app will try and reach the redis database via
#REDIS_URL=http://redis:6379
## DEBUG - The level of debugging output that is enabled on the node.js app
#DEBUG=nlu:*
